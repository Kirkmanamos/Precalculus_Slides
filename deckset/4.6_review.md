$$
y = -2\sin(x)
$$

You must:

- Label amplitude
- Label period
- Show 5 key points
- Show intercepts

# Board Prompt 1

$$
y = 3\sin\left(\frac{x}{2}\right)
$$

---

# Board Prompt 2

$$
y = -\frac{1}{2}\cos(x - \pi)
$$

---

# Board Prompt 3

$$
y = 2\sin(3x - \pi) + 1
$$

---

# Board Prompt 4

$$
y = -3\cos(2\pi x)
$$

---

# Board Prompt 5

## Reverse Engineering

A graph is shown with:

- Amplitude: 2
- Period: $$\pi$$
- Midline: $$y = 1$$
- Starts at a maximum

Write an equation in the form:

$$
y = a\sin(bx - c) + d
$$

---

# Board Prompt 6

## Reverse Engineering

A graph has:

- Amplitude: 1
- Period: $$4\pi$$
- Phase shift: left $$\pi$$
- No vertical shift

Write an equation.

---

# Board Prompt 7

## Error Analysis

A student claims this graph represents:

$$
y = 2\sin(2x - \pi)
$$

But:

- The period appears to be $$2\pi$$.
- The midline is incorrect.

Identify:

1. The mistake.
2. The correct graph features.
3. The corrected equation if necessary.

---

# Board Prompt 8

## Error Analysis

A student graphed:

$$
y = -\cos\left(\frac{x}{2}\right) + 3
$$

But they:

- Reflected incorrectly.
- Applied period after shifting.
- Placed midline at 0.

Explain every mistake and fix it.

# Mid-Lesson Rotation

At 15 minutes:

One group member rotates to a new board  
and must explain the thinking.

No erasing allowed.

# Consolidation Questions

- Which transformations affect x-values?
- Which affect y-values?
- Why must period be determined before phase shift?
- What is the most common mistake today?
