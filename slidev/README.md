# Slidev Projects

This directory stores experimental and future [Slidev](https://sli.dev/) projects for this repo.

## Structure

- `trial-run/` - minimal starter deck used to verify the workflow

## Typical workflow

From a project folder (example: `slidev/trial-run`):

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

If you want a new deck later, copy `trial-run/` to a new folder name and edit `slides.md`.
